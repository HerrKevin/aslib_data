This data was generated for a publication as part of the LION2015.
Note that the feature group ubc_cheap is a subgroup of ubc_all.
Also, the features that belong to ubc_all or tspmeta were considered as deterministic (which actually is not true for all of them) and only computed once per instance. Hence, the feature values and costs on the remaining replications are just duplicates of the values / costs of the first instance.
On the other hand, the features that belong to eax_probing are stochastic and were handled as such.
